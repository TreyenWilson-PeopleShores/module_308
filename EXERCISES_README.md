# JavaScript SBA Preparation Exercises

This repository contains 10 progressive exercises designed to teach you all the skills needed to complete the SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals assessment. By completing these exercises, you'll have approximately 80% of the SBA already done!

## How These Exercises Work

Each exercise is in its own folder and contains:
- **README.md** - Explains what you'll learn and how it relates to the SBA
- **index.js** - Your working file with TODO comments and starter code
- **solution.js** - Complete solution for reference (try not to peek!)

## Exercise Overview

### Exercise 1: Variables and Basic Operations
**Skills:** `let`, `const`, operators, calculations  
**Time:** 15-20 minutes  
Learn to declare variables properly and perform calculations needed for weighted averages.

### Exercise 2: Objects and Arrays Basics
**Skills:** Objects, arrays, property access, manipulation  
**Time:** 20-25 minutes  
Work with the data structures (CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, LearnerSubmission) used in the SBA.

### Exercise 3: Control Flow
**Skills:** `if/else`, `switch`, conditional logic  
**Time:** 25-30 minutes  
Implement validation logic and handle different scoring scenarios.

### Exercise 4: Loops Fundamentals
**Skills:** `for` loops, `while` loops, iteration  
**Time:** 30-35 minutes  
Loop through assignments and submissions to process data.

### Exercise 5: Advanced Loops and Control
**Skills:** `for...of`, `for...in`, `break`, `continue`  
**Time:** 25-30 minutes  
Use more elegant loop patterns and control flow keywords.

### Exercise 6: Functions
**Skills:** Function creation, parameters, return values, helper functions  
**Time:** 35-40 minutes  
Build reusable functions that you'll use in the SBA (percentage calculations, finding data, etc.).

### Exercise 7: Error Handling
**Skills:** `try/catch`, data validation, throwing errors  
**Time:** 30-35 minutes  
Handle edge cases like division by zero and mismatched course IDs.

### Exercise 8: Working with Dates
**Skills:** Date objects, date comparison, determining late submissions  
**Time:** 25-30 minutes  
Compare submission dates with due dates and filter future assignments.

### Exercise 9: Data Transformation and Aggregation
**Skills:** Grouping data, calculating averages, transforming structures  
**Time:** 40-45 minutes  
Transform input data into the exact output format required by the SBA.

### Exercise 10: Integration - Putting It All Together
**Skills:** ALL OF THE ABOVE combined  
**Time:** 60-90 minutes  
Build the complete `getLearnerData()` function - this IS the SBA core logic!

## Recommended Learning Path

1. **Complete exercises in order** - Each builds on previous skills
2. **Try before looking at solutions** - Struggle helps you learn
3. **Run and test your code** - Use `node index.js` to see results
4. **Review solutions** - Compare your approach with the provided solution
5. **Experiment** - Modify the data to test edge cases

## Running the Exercises

Each exercise can be run independently:

```bash
# Navigate to an exercise folder
cd exercise-01-variables

# Run your code
node index.js

# Run the solution to see expected output
node solution.js
```

## How This Prepares You for the SBA

After completing Exercise 10, you'll have:
- ✅ All the core logic for `getLearnerData()`
- ✅ Helper functions for calculations
- ✅ Error handling patterns
- ✅ Date comparison logic
- ✅ Data transformation skills

**What remains for the actual SBA:**
- Polish and refactor your code
- Add comprehensive comments
- Handle additional edge cases
- Test with the provided sandbox data
- Create your README.md
- Make frequent git commits

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't rush** - Take time to understand each concept
2. **Type the code yourself** - Don't copy/paste from solutions
3. **Test frequently** - Run your code after each TODO
4. **Ask questions** - If stuck, research or ask for help
5. **Review requirements** - Check how each exercise maps to SBA requirements
