# Exercise 9: Data Transformation and Aggregation

## Learning Objectives
- Transform data from one structure to another
- Aggregate data by grouping
- Calculate weighted averages
- Build result objects with computed properties

## Instructions
Complete the tasks in `index.js`. Run the file with `node index.js` to test your code.

## Tasks
1. Group submissions by learner
2. Calculate totals and averages
3. Transform data into the SBA output format
4. Build objects with dynamic properties

## SBA Connection
This exercise directly prepares you for the main SBA task:
- Grouping submissions by learner_id
- Calculating weighted averages
- Creating result objects with assignment scores
- Transforming input data into the required output format
