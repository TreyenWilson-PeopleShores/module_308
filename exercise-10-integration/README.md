# Exercise 10: SBA Integration - Putting It All Together

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate all skills learned in previous exercises
- Build a complete solution similar to the SBA
- Practice with realistic data
- Apply proper error handling and validation

## Instructions
Complete the `getLearnerData` function in `index.js`. This exercise combines everything you've learned and closely mimics the actual SBA requirements.

## What This Exercise Covers
This is ~80% of the SBA. After completing this, you'll only need to:
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Handle edge cases for future assignments (not yet due)
- Polish and test your code
- Add any additional validations

## The Function
Create `getLearnerData(CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission])` that:
1. Validates course_id matches
2. Filters out future assignments (not yet due)
3. Calculates percentages with late penalties
4. Groups data by learner
5. Calculates weighted averages
6. Returns properly formatted results

## SBA Connection
This IS the SBA core logic. Complete this and you're 80% done with the actual assessment!
