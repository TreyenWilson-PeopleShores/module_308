# Exercise 1: Variables and Basic Operations

## Learning Objectives
- Declare variables properly using `let` and `const`
- Use operators to perform calculations on variables and literals
- Work with strings, numbers, and Boolean values

## Pre-Exercise Quiz
Test your knowledge before starting:
1. Which of the following is a way to declare a constant in JavaScript?
2. What will the expression "10" + 5 return?
3. How do you check if two values are both equal in value and in type in JavaScript?
4. What is the best practice for declaring a variable in JavaScript?

## Instructions
Complete the tasks in `index.js`. Run the file with `node index.js` to test your code.

## Tasks
1. Declare variables using `const` for values that won't change
2. Declare variables using `let` for values that will change
3. Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
4. Work with comparison operators (===, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
5. Use logical operators (&&, ||, !)
6. Calculate weighted scores (preparation for the SBA)

## SBA Connection
This exercise teaches you the foundation for:
- Storing assignment and submission data
- Calculating percentages and weighted averages
- Comparing scores and points

## Post-Exercise Quiz
Verify your understanding:
1. How can you get the type of a JavaScript variable?
2. What will be the output of console.log(1 + 2 === 3) in JavaScript?
3. Which of the following is the correct operator for exponentiation (raising a number to a power) in JavaScript?
4. Which of the following are primitive data types in JavaScript? (Select all that apply)
5. Given: `let x = '5'; let y = 3; let result = x * y;` - What is the value of result?
