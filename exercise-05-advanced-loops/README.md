# Exercise 5: Advanced Loops and Control

## Learning Objectives
- Use for...of loops to iterate through arrays
- Use for...in loops to iterate through object properties
- Use break to exit loops early
- Use continue to skip iterations
- Choose the right loop type for different scenarios

## Pre-Exercise Quiz
Test your knowledge before starting:
1. What is the purpose of the "break" statement in JavaScript?
2. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the "continue" keyword in JavaScript?
3. Which of the following methods can be used to iterate over an array in JavaScript?
4. How would you iterate over all properties of an object obj in JavaScript?

## Instructions
Complete the tasks in `index.js`. Run the file with `node index.js` to test your code.

## Tasks
1. Use for...of to iterate through array values directly
2. Use for...in to iterate through object properties
3. Use break to stop a loop when a condition is met
4. Use continue to skip certain iterations

## SBA Connection
This exercise teaches you how to:
- Iterate through submissions more elegantly with for...of
- Access object properties dynamically with for...in
- Exit loops early when you find what you need (optimization)
- Skip invalid data with continue
