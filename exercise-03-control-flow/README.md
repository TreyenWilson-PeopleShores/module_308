# Exercise 3: Control Flow

## Learning Objectives
- Use if/else statements to control program flow
- Use switch statements for multiple conditions
- Make decisions based on data validation
- Handle different scenarios in grading logic

## Instructions
Complete the tasks in `index.js`. Run the file with `node index.js` to test your code.

## Tasks
1. Write if/else statements to check conditions
2. Create nested if/else for complex logic
3. Use a switch statement for categorizing data
4. Apply control flow to grading scenarios

## SBA Connection
This exercise teaches you how to:
- Validate that course_id matches between objects
- Check if assignments are late
- Determine if assignments should be included in calculations
- Handle different scoring scenarios
