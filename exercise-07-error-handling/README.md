# Exercise 7: Error Handling

## Learning Objectives
- Use try/catch blocks to handle errors
- Validate data before processing
- Throw custom error messages
- Handle different types of errors gracefully

## Instructions
Complete the tasks in `index.js`. Run the file with `node index.js` to test your code.

## Tasks
1. Use try/catch to handle potential errors
2. Validate data and throw errors when invalid
3. Handle division by zero
4. Handle incorrect data types

## SBA Connection
This exercise teaches you how to:
- Validate that course_id matches (throw error if not)
- Handle points_possible being 0 (can't divide by zero)
- Check for incorrect data types (string instead of number)
- Make your SBA code robust and error-resistant
