# Exercise 4: Loops Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Use for loops to iterate through arrays
- Use while loops for condition-based iteration
- Understand when to use each type of loop
- Process array data with loops

## Pre-Exercise Quiz
Test your knowledge before starting:
1. Which of the following loops will run a block of code a specified number of times in JavaScript?
2. Which statement will execute a block of code at least once, and then repeat it while a condition is true?
3. How do you repeat a block of code as long as a specific condition is true?
4. Which of the following can be used to indefinitely repeat a block of code in JavaScript?

## Instructions
Complete the tasks in `index.js`. Run the file with `node index.js` to test your code.

## Tasks
1. Use a for loop to iterate through an array of assignments
2. Use a while loop to process data until a condition is met
3. Calculate totals using loops
4. Find specific items in arrays using loops

## SBA Connection
This exercise teaches you how to:
- Loop through arrays of assignments
- Loop through learner submissions
- Calculate cumulative totals for weighted averages
- Process multiple data points
