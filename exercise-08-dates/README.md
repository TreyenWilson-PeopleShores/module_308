## Learning Objectives
- Parse date strings
- Compare dates
- Determine if a submission is late
- Handle date-based logic

## Instructions
Complete the tasks in `index.js`. Run the file with `node index.js` to test your code.

## Tasks
1. Parse date strings into Date objects
2. Compare dates to check if submission is late
3. Check if an assignment is due yet
4. Calculate time differences

## SBA Connection
